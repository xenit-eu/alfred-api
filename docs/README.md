# Documentation Alfred API

## Generate website

This directory generates the product documentation website at https://docs.xenit.eu/alfred-api/ 

This is done by manually executing:
```bash
./build-website.sh
```

This will generate a ZIP containing the documentation website, which still needs to be
uploaded and unzipped on our host.
